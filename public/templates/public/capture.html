  <p class="lead">This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for
    calling extra attention to featured content or information.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>Your actual work experience, the ability to apply your skills and
    experience, as well as your value to clients, customers, employers and
    team members are of vital value to such persons in the future, but are
    difficult to accumulate and record.</p>
  <p>WexLog gives you that ability in an easily-verifiable and trustworthy
    way. Each project, job and work position can be recorded and verified
    in real-time, and be retained for the future in a structure that is
    easily searchable by clients, customers and employers who need a precise
    set of skills, experience, training and education, using a sophisticated
    and easy to use search function. Even the most unusual and esoteric
    skills and knowledge are catered for. If what you offer is not listed,
    you can add a descriptor, which creates a prompt for future searchers
    to enable them to find you.</p>
  <p>Your entries can be verified by the client, customer or employer in
    real-time, providing a living CV, which you can make available to searchers.</p>
  <p>Because the service offered by WexLog is internet-based you record
    your capabilities on an international platform, enabling searchers to
    find you wherever you – and they – may be. To make it even more
    convenient, your record can also be verified internationally, quickly
    and easily.</p>
  <p>The range of skills you can record is unlimited; one WexLog member is
    a lawyer, a management consultant skilled in profit improvement, new
    unit handholding and employment creation, a fiction novelist, a blogger,
    and a copywriter, as well as a financial mathematician and a long-distance
    sailor, as well as being experienced in fifteen countries. All of these
    attributes and qualities are separately and jointly searchable in one
    place.
