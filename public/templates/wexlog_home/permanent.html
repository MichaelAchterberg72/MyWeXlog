            <p>Whether you are seriously looking for a new position, or just
              considering it as a possibility, or wanting to take that next step in
              your career and not finding it in your present employer, WexLog allows
              you to make a facts-based assessment of the market, without high cost
              and without disclosing your attentions to the world until you are ready.
              WexLog brings together in an easily-searchable database a broad range
              of potential employers, whether they are presently looking for someone
              like you or have not yet reached that stage. When you have decided which
              potential employers are right for you, you can make the approach through
              WexLog, to reach the part of the organisation that is most receptive to
              your offer, without having to climb the organisational ladder, with all
              its uncertainties. WexLog gives you the information you need to make a
              targeted, rational approach in a private discussion, and without the
              formalistic delays often associated with such actions. Even better,
              your Trust Passport on WexLog, a contemporaneous recording of your work
              and experience, verified by your employer, your supervisor or a
              colleague, provides excellent evidence of your work history, avoiding
              the need for voluminous correspondence with such people who can attest
              to your skills, something that you may wish to avoid at a sensitive time.</p>
            <p>The search for a permanent employee poses risks: finding the right person
              can also entail telling your competitors what you are looking for, perhaps
              tipping them off before you are ready to tell the world of your needs.
              WexLog allows you insight into what is available, the availability of
              skills that can help you to achieve your staffing objectives. You can
              make a targeted approach to he people you want, knowing in advance what
              you will be getting. WexLog takes the guesswork and hope out of
              recruitment, providing verified facts on which to base a sound
              decision. Best of all, WexLog permits you to act quickly and effectively,
              at the lowest possible cost.</p>
