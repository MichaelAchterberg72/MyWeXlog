  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>The hardest part of being a freelancer, a consultant or
    a contractor is finding the work. In many cases, the cost of this can
    be 30% or even more of the value of a contract! The alternative is to
    use a broker or agent to do the search, which also comes at a cost. And
    the results are still largely the result of chance, of making the enquiry
    at the time the  vacancy is open.</p>
  <p>WexLog allows you to take a large part of the cost and chance out of
    the process, by allowing you to post your qualifications in a place where
    you will be found by the people who search for those educational
    qualifications, experience and skills at the time they do the search.
    You are no longer dependent on good luck, the memory of the searcher or
    the agents contacts with the people who may want you. Best of all, you
    are able to include the date on which you will be available for a project,
    so the searchers can look for you for future work.</p>
