  <p>WexLog provides a convenient and reliable way to obtain and record
    daily, weekly, monthly or project activities, with a real-time recording
    of the evaluation by your employer, client or customer. It is no longer
    necessary to obtain a written testimonial. It is no longer necessary to
    locate a supervisor who has left the company, a client who has moved to
    another start-up business, or a customer who has bought a new home.
    WexLog records and keeps your work and skills history as they happen,
    and makes them available when you need them.</p>
  <p>WexLog is a perfect way to facilitate and encourage repeat business
    from a satisfied client or customer, or an offer from a past employer
    who might have lost track of your progress. As a good performer, you
    no longer fade into background memory or, even worse, into an outdated
    memory of what you were back then. You remain a trusted, identifiable
    and easily fond resource, with known and updated skills and experience.
