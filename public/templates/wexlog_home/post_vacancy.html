            <p>Finding the right consultant, contractor or
              freelancer can be a nightmare, requiring extensive investigation
              and checking. When the job is completed, you sit back and relax,
              to prepare for the next round, often needing to undergo the whole
              process again, because the best of those available are committed
              on other projects, or you have lost track of them and have to start
              the process from the beginning again after a year or three. WeXlog
